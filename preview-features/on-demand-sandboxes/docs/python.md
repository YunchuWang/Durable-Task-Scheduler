# On-demand Sandboxes: Python guide

> **Status:** Private preview · [Back to overview](./README.md)

This guide walks through using On-demand Sandboxes with the **Python** Durable Task SDK.
Make sure you've read the [overview](./README.md) first.

On-demand Sandboxes use a two-part model: a **sandbox worker profile** (the *declarer
app*) that tells DTS which activities to offload, and a **worker image** that contains
those activity implementations. Your orchestrator still calls activities the same way it
always has. The decision to run one in a sandbox lives entirely in the profile
configuration.

## Install the SDK

The on-demand sandbox APIs ship under the `durabletask.azuremanaged.preview.sandboxes`
namespace. Install the Azure-managed Durable Task package (it pulls in the core
`durabletask` SDK):

```bash
pip install durabletask-azuremanaged==1.6.0
```

## Step 1: Declare a sandbox worker profile

The declarer app uses a decorated profile class to declare the remote worker image and
activity ownership, then enables sandbox activities on the DTS client. The profile sets
the image, the managed identities DTS needs to pull the image and start the sandbox, the
resource shape, concurrency, any customer environment variables, and the activity names
to offload with `options.add_activity(...)`.

```python
import os

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

from durabletask import client, task
from durabletask.azuremanaged.client import DurableTaskSchedulerClient
from durabletask.azuremanaged.preview.sandboxes import (
    SandboxActivitiesClient,
    SandboxWorkerProfile,
    sandbox_worker_profile,
)
from durabletask.azuremanaged.worker import DurableTaskSchedulerWorker

REMOTE_HELLO = "remote_hello"

endpoint = os.environ["DTS_ENDPOINT"]
taskhub_name = os.environ["DTS_TASK_HUB"]
worker_profile_id = os.getenv("DTS_WORKER_PROFILE_ID", "default")
container_image = os.environ["DTS_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_IMAGE"]


def hello_orchestrator(ctx: task.OrchestrationContext, name: str):
    """Orchestrator that calls an activity executed by the remote sandbox worker."""
    return (yield ctx.call_activity(REMOTE_HELLO, input=name))


@sandbox_worker_profile(worker_profile_id)
class RemoteWorkerProfile(SandboxWorkerProfile):
    def configure(self, options) -> None:
        options.image.image_ref = container_image
        options.image.managed_identity_client_id = os.environ[
            "DTS_SANDBOX_IMAGE_PULL_UMI_CLIENT_ID"]
        options.scheduler_managed_identity_client_id = os.environ[
            "DTS_SANDBOX_SCHEDULER_UMI_CLIENT_ID"]
        options.cpu = "1000m"
        options.memory = "2048Mi"
        options.max_concurrent_activities = 1
        options.environment_variables["SAMPLE_MARKER"] = "python-sample-marker"
        options.add_activity(REMOTE_HELLO)


credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Declare the sandbox worker profile with DTS so it can route the activity to a sandbox.
sandbox_client = SandboxActivitiesClient(
    host_address=endpoint,
    secure_channel=True,
    taskhub=taskhub_name,
    token_credential=credential)
sandbox_client.enable_sandbox_activities()

with DurableTaskSchedulerWorker(
        host_address=endpoint,
        secure_channel=True,
        taskhub=taskhub_name,
        token_credential=credential) as worker:
    worker.add_orchestrator(hello_orchestrator)
    worker.use_work_item_filters()
    worker.start()

    durable_client = DurableTaskSchedulerClient(
        host_address=endpoint,
        secure_channel=True,
        taskhub=taskhub_name,
        token_credential=credential)
    instance_id = durable_client.schedule_new_orchestration(
        hello_orchestrator, input="on-demand sandbox Python")
    state = durable_client.wait_for_orchestration_completion(instance_id, timeout=300)
    print(state.serialized_output if state else "no result")
```

`enable_sandbox_activities()` is the key call. It registers the declared profiles with DTS
so it can route those activities to the sandbox image. `use_work_item_filters()` keeps
sandbox activities from being dispatched to this in-process worker.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The managed identities referenced by `options.image.managed_identity_client_id` and
> `options.scheduler_managed_identity_client_id` must both be attached to the scheduler.
> The image-pull identity must have the **AcrPull** role on your container registry, and

The orchestrator call site doesn't change. It calls `REMOTE_HELLO` the same way it would
call any activity, and DTS routes it to the sandbox.

### Worker profile configuration reference

The table below lists each profile option, what it controls, its accepted values, and its
default.

| Setting | What it controls | Accepted values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `image.image_ref` | The container image that holds your activity implementations. | A full OCI image reference, by tag (`myregistry.azurecr.io/workers/hello:1.0`) or digest (`myregistry.azurecr.io/workers/hello@sha256:...`). | *Required* |
| `image.managed_identity_client_id` | The client ID of the user-assigned managed identity DTS uses to **pull the worker image** from your registry. This identity needs the **AcrPull** role on the registry. | A user-assigned managed identity client ID (GUID). Must be attached to the scheduler. | *Required* |
| `scheduler_managed_identity_client_id` | The client ID of the user-assigned managed identity the **sandbox worker uses to connect back to DTS**, and that the activity code runs as when calling other services. | A user-assigned managed identity client ID (GUID). Must be attached to the scheduler. Can be the same identity as the image-pull identity or a different one. | *Required* |
| `cpu` | CPU quantity declared for each sandbox. | A positive CPU quantity, expressed in millicores (`500m`, `1000m`) or whole/fractional cores (`2`, `0.5`). | `1000m` (1 vCPU) |
| `memory` | Memory quantity declared for each sandbox. | A positive memory quantity, such as `256Mi`, `1Gi`, or a bare number interpreted as MiB (`2048`). | `2048Mi` |
| `max_concurrent_activities` | How many activities a single sandbox worker instance processes concurrently. | An integer greater than `0`. There is no enforced upper bound; size it to what your activity and resource shape can handle. | `100` |
| `environment_variables` | Customer environment variables injected into the sandbox at runtime. | A map of string keys to string values. | Empty |
| *(profile id)* | Friendly profile id that groups the image, resources, and activities for monitoring and reuse. | A non-empty string, unique across your declared profiles. | `default` |
| `add_activity(...)` | The activity names this profile offloads to the sandbox. | One or more activity names. At least one is required; an activity can belong to only one profile. | *Required* |

> [!NOTE]
> CPU and memory must be positive resource quantities. The platform may apply additional
> per-preview ceilings on the total CPU and memory a sandbox can request. Check your
> private preview onboarding details for the current limits.

## Configure the scheduler identity for image pull

To start a sandbox, DTS pulls your worker image from your container registry on your
behalf. It does this using a **user-assigned managed identity** attached to the scheduler.
That identity must be granted the **AcrPull** role on the Azure Container Registry that
hosts your worker image, and the scheduler must have the identity attached.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only **user-assigned** managed identities are supported. System-assigned managed
> identities are not supported at this time.

The worker profile distinguishes two identities, and you can use the same identity for
both or split them:

- **Image-pull identity** (`options.image.managed_identity_client_id`): the identity DTS
  uses to **pull the worker image** from your registry. This identity needs the **AcrPull**
  role on the registry.
- **Worker/scheduler identity** (`options.scheduler_managed_identity_client_id`): the
  identity the **sandbox worker uses to connect back to Durable Task Scheduler**, and the
  identity your activity code runs as when it calls other services (for example, Storage,
  Key Vault, or a database). Grant this identity whatever roles your activity code needs on
  those downstream services.

Both identities must be attached to the scheduler. Using two separate identities lets you
scope image-pull permissions narrowly while granting your activity code only the
downstream permissions it needs.

### 1. Grant the identity the AcrPull role on your registry

Assign the **AcrPull** role to the **image-pull** user-assigned managed identity, scoped
to your registry:

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "<image-pull-identity-principal-id>" \
  --role "AcrPull" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<registry-name>"
```

Without this role assignment, DTS cannot pull the worker image and the sandbox will fail
to start. If your activity code calls other Azure services, grant the **worker/scheduler**
identity the roles it needs on those services as well.

### 2. Attach the identity to the scheduler

The scheduler must have the user-assigned identity attached. The
[`durabletask` Azure CLI extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/durabletask)
provides identity commands that handle this for you. Install it with
`az extension add --name durabletask` if you haven't already.

Attach the identity to an existing scheduler:

```bash
az durabletask scheduler identity assign \
  --resource-group "<resource-group>" \
  --name "<scheduler-name>" \
  --user-assigned "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/<identity-name>"
```

To attach multiple identities (for example, separate image-pull and worker/scheduler
identities), pass several space-separated resource IDs to `--user-assigned`. Verify what's
attached with `az durabletask scheduler identity show --resource-group "<resource-group>" --name "<scheduler-name>"`.

Once the identities are attached to the scheduler (the image-pull identity with the
**AcrPull** role on your registry), reference their client IDs on the worker profile
(`options.image.managed_identity_client_id` and
`options.scheduler_managed_identity_client_id`) so DTS uses the image-pull identity to pull
the image and the worker/scheduler identity for the sandbox worker to connect back to DTS
and call downstream services.

## Step 2: Build the worker image

The worker image runs `SandboxWorker()`, registers the activity implementations it owns,
and starts. The sandbox worker does **not** configure the DTS endpoint, task hub, profile
id, or credentials. `SandboxWorker()` reads the runtime settings (such as `DTS_ENDPOINT`,
`DTS_TASK_HUB`, `DTS_WORKER_PROFILE_ID`, and `DTS_SANDBOX_ID`) from environment variables
that DTS injects when it starts the container.

```python
import os
import threading

from durabletask import task
from durabletask.azuremanaged.preview.sandboxes import SandboxWorker

REMOTE_HELLO = "remote_hello"


def _remote_hello(ctx: task.ActivityContext, name: str) -> str:
    """Activity function that runs inside the on-demand sandbox worker container."""
    sandbox_id = os.getenv("DTS_SANDBOX_ID", "unknown-sandbox")
    return f"Hello {name} from Python on-demand sandbox worker {sandbox_id}!"


# The registered activity name must match the name declared in the worker profile.
_remote_hello.__name__ = REMOTE_HELLO

with SandboxWorker() as worker:
    worker.add_activity(_remote_hello)
    worker.start()
    print("Python on-demand sandbox remote worker is running.")
    try:
        threading.Event().wait()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
```

Keep the activity name constant (here, `REMOTE_HELLO`) in a small shared module so the
declarer app and the remote worker stay in sync. When the worker connects, it reports its
registered activity names, and DTS validates they match the declaration before
advertising worker capacity.

Build and push the image with a `Containerfile`/`Dockerfile` that installs the SDK and
your activity's dependencies, then copies in the worker entry point:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
FROM python:3.12-slim AS runtime
WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
ENV GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

# Install the Durable Task SDK (with the sandboxes extension), plus your
# activity dependencies.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir durabletask-azuremanaged==1.6.0

COPY remote_worker.py /app/remote_worker.py
COPY activities.py /app/activities.py

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/app/remote_worker.py"]
```

```bash
docker build -f Containerfile -t <container image reference> .
docker push <container image reference>
```

Then set the image reference on the declarer profile (for example, via the
`DTS_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_IMAGE` environment variable). DTS pulls the image using the
image-pull managed identity you configured on the profile, which must have the
**AcrPull** role on your registry.

## Step 3: View logs in the DTS dashboard

Once your sandbox activities are running, you can view their execution logs directly in
the Durable Task Scheduler dashboard. The dashboard shows real-time output from your
managed workers, including stdout, stderr, and activity lifecycle events, giving you full
visibility into what's happening inside the sandbox without configuring external log
sinks or building your own observability pipeline.
