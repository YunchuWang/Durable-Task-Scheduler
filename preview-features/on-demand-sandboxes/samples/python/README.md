# On-demand Sandboxes demo (Python): LLM-generated code interpreter

A three-step Durable Task workflow that demonstrates the **On-demand Sandboxes** preview of Azure Durable
Task Scheduler (DTS), using the `durabletask.azuremanaged.preview.sandboxes`
package.

The orchestrator asks a natural-language question over `data/sales_q1.csv`. The LLM
returns a self-contained pandas script. That script is **untrusted** code, so it runs
in a DTS-managed on-demand sandbox, not in the orchestrator's process. The first and
last activities stay in-process; `execute_code` is fanned out one sandbox execution
per region partition.

## Layout

```
python/
├── activities.py        # Shared activity identities (execute_code is a SandboxActivity)
├── main_app.py          # Declarer app: orchestrator + in-process activities + profile
├── remote_worker.py     # Sandbox worker image entrypoint: runs execute_code via python3
├── Containerfile        # Builds the remote worker (sandbox) image
├── Containerfile.mainapp # Builds the main_app image deployed to Azure Container Apps
├── requirements.txt     # Declarer-app dependencies
├── azure.yaml           # azd service + hooks (Deploy to Azure)
├── infra/               # Bicep: Container Apps, ACR, identity, Azure OpenAI, scheduler wiring
├── scripts/             # acr-build.sh + attach-scheduler-identity.sh (azd hooks)
└── data/sales_q1.csv    # Sample dataset (~300 rows)
```

- `execute_code` is declared as an on-demand sandbox activity by the `code-executor`
  worker profile (the `@sandbox_worker_profile` class in `main_app.py`). It is never
  registered on the main app worker.
- `generate_code` and `format_answer` run in-process in the main app worker.

## Prerequisites (local development)

These prerequisites are for running the sample **locally** (building the sandbox image
and running the orchestrator on your machine). To deploy to Azure instead, skip to
[Deploy to Azure (AKS) with `azd`](#deploy-to-azure-aks-with-azd), which has its own
prerequisites.

- Python 3.12+
- Docker (to build the sandbox image)
- Azure CLI (`az`), signed in with access to the scheduler, ACR, and Azure OpenAI
- A DTS scheduler + task hub with the On-demand Sandboxes preview enabled
- An Azure Container Registry the image-pull identity can pull from (granted AcrPull)
- Two user-assigned managed identities (image pull + scheduler connect)
- An Azure OpenAI deployment of a chat model (GPT-5.1, GPT-5, GPT-4.1, etc.)

## Choose a workflow

This sample supports two workflows:

- **Manual/local run:** install Python dependencies, build and push the sandbox image yourself, then run the orchestrator with `python main_app.py`.
- **Azure deploy with `azd`:** skip the manual install/build/run sections below and go straight to **Deploy to Azure (Container Apps) with `azd`**. `azd up` provisions the cloud resources, builds and pushes the sandbox image via ACR Tasks, deploys the `main_app` Container App, and the deployed app starts the orchestration on startup.

## Manual: Install

From the `python/` directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Manual: Build the sandbox image

From the `python/` directory:

```bash
ACR=<your-acr-name>
IMAGE=$ACR.azurecr.io/dts-codegen-sandbox-python:v1

docker build \
  -f Containerfile \
  -t $IMAGE \
  .

az acr login --name $ACR
docker push $IMAGE

# DTS pulls the sandbox image using the image-pull managed identity (not anonymous
# pull). Grant that identity AcrPull on the registry -- use the same UMI you pass as
# DTS_SANDBOX_IMAGE_PULL_UMI_CLIENT_ID when running the orchestrator.
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "<image-pull UMI client ID>" \
  --role AcrPull \
  --scope "$(az acr show --name $ACR --query id -o tsv)"
```

## Manual: Run the orchestrator

```bash
export DTS_ENDPOINT="https://<scheduler-endpoint>"
export DTS_TASK_HUB="<task-hub>"
export DTS_WORKER_PROFILE_ID="code-executor"
export DTS_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_IMAGE="<acr>.azurecr.io/dts-codegen-sandbox-python:v1"
export DTS_SANDBOX_IMAGE_PULL_UMI_CLIENT_ID="<image-pull UMI client ID>"
export DTS_SANDBOX_SCHEDULER_UMI_CLIENT_ID="<scheduler UMI client ID>"

export AOAI_ENDPOINT="https://<your-aoai>.openai.azure.com"
export AOAI_DEPLOYMENT="<your-chat-deployment>"

# Sign in so DefaultAzureCredential can reach DTS and Azure OpenAI
az login

python main_app.py "Which region had the highest total revenue in March 2025?"
```

The declarer prints a dataset preview, the AOAI-generated Python (prefixed
`[generate]`), the orchestration id, and the final answer. The sandbox container
logs (prefixed `[sandbox]`) stream through the DTS dashboard's **On-demand
Sandboxes** tab while `execute_code` runs.

## Deploy to Azure (Container Apps) with `azd`

The `infra/` folder and `azure.yaml` deploy the **main_app** orchestrator to **Azure
Container Apps** with [`azd`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
The sandbox worker image (`remote_worker.py`) is built and pushed to ACR; DTS starts it
on demand, so it is never deployed as a Container App.
<<<<<<< HEAD

If you use this path, you do not need to run the manual `pip install`, `docker build`,
`docker push`, or `python main_app.py` commands above.

> The Durable Task Scheduler is **not created** by this template. You pass in an
> existing one. On-demand Sandboxes is a private-preview feature that must be enabled on
> the scheduler out of band, so the scheduler is patched separately and supplied here by
> name. The scheduler must be in a supported preview region: East US 2, West US 3, North
> Europe, or Australia East.

### What gets provisioned

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Azure Container Apps environment** + **main_app container app** | Hosts the `main_app` orchestrator (user-assigned identity attached) |
| **Azure Container Registry** | Stores the main-app and sandbox-worker images (built server-side via ACR Tasks) |
| **User-assigned managed identity** | Container App auth to DTS/Azure OpenAI, ACR pull for the sandbox, and the sandbox's connection back to DTS |
| **Azure OpenAI** + `gpt-5.1` deployment | Backs the in-process `generate_code` activity |

The deployment also **ensures the task hub** exists, grants the identity the roles it
needs (AcrPull, Durable Task data access, Cognitive Services OpenAI User), and a
`postprovision` hook **attaches the identity to your scheduler** (a merge-safe PATCH).

### Prerequisites (Azure deployment)

- An existing **DTS scheduler** with the On-demand Sandboxes preview enabled, and its
  resource group name.
- [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) and [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- Azure OpenAI quota for `gpt-5.1` (`GlobalStandard`) in your target region (default
  `eastus`; override with `AZURE_OPENAI_LOCATION`).

> Run all `azd` commands from this sample folder (`preview-features/on-demand-sandboxes/samples/python`),
> not from the repository root. Running `azd init` at the repository root makes `azd`
> scan unrelated samples and can fail on tools this sample does not need.
>

### Deploy

```bash
cd preview-features/on-demand-sandboxes/samples/python

azd auth login && az login

# First time only. Run this from the sample folder so azd uses this azure.yaml.
azd init

# Point the template at your existing (preview-enabled) scheduler.
azd env set DTS_SCHEDULER_NAME "<scheduler-name>"
azd env set DTS_SCHEDULER_RESOURCE_GROUP "<scheduler-resource-group>"
# Create the sample's user-assigned identity in the scheduler's region so it can
# be attached to the scheduler. Azure OpenAI can be in a separate region.
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION "<scheduler-location>"
azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_LOCATION "<aoai-location-with-gpt-5.1-quota>"
# Optional override: DTS_TASK_HUB (default: default)

azd up
```

`azd` provisions the resources, builds both images via ACR Tasks, attaches the identity
to your scheduler, and deploys the `main_app` container app. If you don't set
`DTS_SCHEDULER_NAME` / `DTS_SCHEDULER_RESOURCE_GROUP` first, `azd` prompts for them.

### Verify

```bash
# Stream main_app logs from the container app (name from `azd env get-values`).
az containerapp logs show --name <container-app-name> --resource-group <rg-name> --follow
```

The `main_app` container runs the orchestration; `[sandbox]` logs from `execute_code` stream in
the DTS dashboard's **On-demand Sandboxes** tab.

### Clean up

```bash
azd down
```

This removes the resources the template created. Your scheduler is left untouched (it was
not created here); detach the identity manually if you no longer need it.

## Sample questions to try

- `Which region had the highest total revenue in March 2025?`
- `What was the best-selling product in Q1?`
- `Average revenue per transaction in February?`

## What's in-process vs on-demand sandbox

| Activity        | Runs where    | Why                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| generate_code   | In-process    | Plain Azure OpenAI HTTP call. No reason to split out. |
| execute_code    | **Sandbox**   | Untrusted LLM-generated code + different runtime.     |
| format_answer   | In-process    | Trivial result aggregation.                           |

Only `execute_code` is declared on the `code-executor` sandbox worker profile via
`options.add_activity(...)`. Everything else runs wherever the orchestrator runs.
